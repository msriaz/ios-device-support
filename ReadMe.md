## Introduction

Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE), is essential for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. To develop and test your apps effectively, you often require up-to-date device support files that allow you to deploy and debug your applications on specific iOS device versions.

This repository is here to help developers who already have Xcode installed but need additional or updated device support files. By following the instructions below, you can easily integrate the necessary device support files into your existing Xcode setup.

## How to Use

If you've already installed Xcode and need to update or add specific device support files, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Appropriate iOS Version**: Inside the repository, navigate to the folder that corresponds to the iOS or watchOS version you want to add or update device support for and download it. 

2. **Copy Downloaded Device Support Files**: Copy these files from your download location.

3. **Paste Files into Xcode Directory**: Navigate to your Xcode installation directory. Typically, this directory is located at `Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport`. Paste the copied device support files into this directory.

4. **Restart Xcode**: Restart Xcode to ensure that the new or updated device support files are recognized and applied.

Now, your Xcode setup should be equipped with the necessary device support files, allowing you to deploy and debug your apps on the specific iOS or watchOS device version you added or updated support for.
